## üé§ VOICE CONTROL - WORLD'S FIRST VOICE-CONTROLLED IDE

### What We Built
**Full voice recognition and control** for Azora IDE - the ONLY IDE with complete voice interaction.

### Key Features

#### 1. Natural Language Commands
Just speak naturally to your IDE:
- "Hey Azora, create a React component called UserProfile"
- "Fix the bug in the authentication module"
- "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"
- "Refactor this function for better performance"
- "Generate tests with 95% coverage"
- "Start continuous development mode"

#### 2. Wake Word Detection
- "Hey Azora" - Get IDE's attention
- "Hi Azora" - Alternative wake word
- Continuous listening mode available

#### 3. Intent Recognition
Automatically understands what you want:
- **Code Generation**: "create", "generate", "build", "make"
- **Code Review**: "review", "check", "analyze"
- **Refactoring**: "refactor", "optimize", "improve"
- **Debugging**: "debug", "fix", "error", "bug"
- **Testing**: "test", "unit test"
- **Documentation**: "document", "docs", "comment"
- **Agent Summoning**: "get help from", "ask the CTO"

#### 4. Voice Responses
IDE speaks back to you:
- Confirms actions
- Reports progress
- Announces completions
- Pleasant voice synthesis

#### 5. Multi-Agent Integration
Voice commands automatically invoke the best agents:
- Security reviews ‚Üí Chief Security Officer
- Architecture questions ‚Üí CTO
- Performance ‚Üí Infrastructure Architect
- Complex tasks ‚Üí Multi-agent collaboration

### Technical Implementation
