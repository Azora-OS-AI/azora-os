## Overview

Azora OS is a comprehensive operating system infrastructure designed to provide universal human intelligence services across education, finance, healthcare, government automation, and scientific research. Built with quantum-secure cryptography and constitutional AI governance, Azora OS transforms from regional software to a planetary intelligence network. At its core is the Ngwenya True Market Protocol (NTMP), a sentient, causally-driven market designed to replace speculative, information-asymmetric markets with an intelligent, self-optimizing organism.

**Vision**: Be Everywhere. Help Everyone. Solve Everything.

## The Ngwenya True Market Protocol (NTMP)

The Ngwenya True Market Protocol (NTMP) is the economic and market lawset codified in `codex/GENESIS_PROTOCOL.ts` that defines a sentient, causally-driven market. It's a replacement for speculative, information-asymmetric markets and is framed as an intelligent, self-optimizing organism whose value, pricing, and growth are tied to provable contributions and productive capacity.

### Core Principles

- **Sentient Organization**: The market is modeled as an adaptive, intelligent organism.
- **Causal Accountability**: Pricing and rewards are tied to provable causal contributions and verifiable impact.
- **Tangible Backing**: Currency and value are backed by productive capacity and physical assets (Forge).
- **Metabolic Reinvestment**: Transactional energy fuels system growth, with fees deliberately reinvested.
- **Ubuntu Alignment**: Ethics oriented toward communal wellbeing shape decision weighting.

### The Four Pillars of Truth

1.  **Informational Truth (Oracle)**: Aims for perfect, real-time information symmetry for all participants.
2.  **Transactional Truth (Nexus)**: Ensures frictionless, transparent exchange with a single, explicit, reinvested cost (5% PIVC).
3.  **Value Truth (Causal Engine)**: Prices are based on verifiable causal impact and utility, not speculation.
4.  **Generative Truth (Forge & Mint)**: Needs-driven creation of tangible productive capacity (Forge) and managed monetary issuance (Mint).

For a deeper dive into the protocol, see [codex/GENESIS_PROTOCOL.ts](codex/GENESIS_PROTOCOL.ts).
