# 🚀 Azora OS - Africa's First Autonomous AI Company

> **Built in South Africa. For South Africa. By Sizwe Ngwenya.**

**Azora OS** is Africa's first self-improving, self-healing AI platform for logistics and operations. Unlike traditional AI companies that rent technology from Silicon Valley, we built our own neural network from scratch - 480 neurons, genetic evolution, quantum-inspired activation, 100% local processing.
