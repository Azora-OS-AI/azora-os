## 🇿🇦 Made in South Africa

This project was conceived, designed, and built in South Africa by a 25-year-old young man with a background in Physical Scienc & Mathematics from NMU and Computer Science from UCT.

**Not funded by Silicon Valley. Not using Silicon Valley's AI. Not following Silicon Valley's playbook.**

**This is African innovation. This is our AI. This is our future.**

---

## 🔥 The Bottom Line

Azora OS isn't just software. It's a statement:

✅ **We don't need to rent AI from America**  
✅ **We can build world-class technology in Africa**  
✅ **We can compete with billion-dollar companies**  
✅ **We can own our digital future**

**Join us. Let's make Africa the AI capital of the world.**

🇿🇦 🚀 🧠

---

**Built with passion. Powered by determination. Made in South Africa.**

_"They said we couldn't build AI in Africa. So I built it just to prove them wrong."_
