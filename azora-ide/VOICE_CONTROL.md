## üìä Development Cycle

Each cycle (every 5 minutes):

```
1. üìä Analysis Phase (30s)
   ‚Ä¢ Scan codebase for issues
   ‚Ä¢ Identify bugs, security vulnerabilities
   ‚Ä¢ Check performance bottlenecks
   ‚Ä¢ Measure test coverage

2. üéØ Task Generation (15s)
   ‚Ä¢ Generate tasks from issues
   ‚Ä¢ Prioritize by severity
   ‚Ä¢ Assign to appropriate agents

3. ‚ö° Prioritization (5s)
   ‚Ä¢ Critical security issues first
   ‚Ä¢ Then high-priority bugs
   ‚Ä¢ Then optimizations
   ‚Ä¢ Finally documentation

4. ‚öôÔ∏è Execution (3-4 minutes)
   ‚Ä¢ Execute top 5 tasks
   ‚Ä¢ Multiple agents working in parallel
   ‚Ä¢ Real-time progress updates

5. üß™ Testing (30s)
   ‚Ä¢ Run full test suite
   ‚Ä¢ Verify no regressions
   ‚Ä¢ Check coverage improved

6. üìù Report (10s)
   ‚Ä¢ Generate cycle report
   ‚Ä¢ Notify of changes
   ‚Ä¢ Request review if needed
```

## üéì Examples

### Example 1: Voice-Controlled Development
```
You: "Hey Azora, create a user registration component"
Azora: "Creating user registration component with validation..."
[2 minutes later]
Azora: "Component created with email validation, password strength check, 
        and tests. 3 agents collaborated on this. Check your editor."
```

### Example 2: Continuous Development
```
[5:00 PM] You start continuous development mode
[5:05 PM] AI fixes null pointer bug in auth.ts
[5:10 PM] AI optimizes database queries (30% faster)
[5:15 PM] AI generates 20 new tests (coverage: 65% ‚Üí 78%)
[5:20 PM] AI documents 15 undocumented functions
[5:25 PM] AI refactors UserService for better maintainability
[6:00 PM] You check back: 25 improvements made, all tests passing
```

### Example 3: Combined Usage
```
You: "Hey Azora, start continuous development mode"
Azora: "Continuous development activated. I'll keep improving your code."
[You continue working on features]
[AI works in background on bugs, tests, docs]
[You get notifications of improvements]
[You review and approve changes]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Requires Review
- By default, all changes require manual review
- Set `autoApprove: true` for full autonomy (not recommended)
- Breaking changes always require approval

### Works Best With
- TypeScript/JavaScript projects
- Test suites (Jest, Mocha, etc.)
- Git version control
- Good internet connection (for AI services)

### Performance Impact
- Minimal: Runs in background
- Uses idle CPU/memory
- Can be paused anytime

### Data Privacy
- All processing happens locally where possible
- Some AI features require cloud API calls
- See privacy policy for details

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Voice Control Not Working
```bash
# Check browser permissions
# Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Microphone
# Allow microphone access for Azora IDE

# Test microphone
# Say "Hey Azora" clearly
# Check console for recognition logs
```

### Continuous Development Issues
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f ~/.azora-ide/continuous-dev.log

# Verify agents are running
curl http://localhost:4000/api/agents/status

# Restart continuous development
Menu ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Stop Continuous Development
Menu ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Start Continuous Development
```

## üöÄ Pro Tips

1. **Use Voice for Quick Tasks**: "Fix this bug" while reviewing code
2. **Enable Continuous Dev at Night**: Let AI work while you sleep
3. **Review Changes in Morning**: Approve overnight improvements
4. **Combine with Multi-Agent**: Best of both worlds
5. **Set Conservative Goals**: Start with 80% coverage, increase later
