## 💼 PITCH TALKING POINTS

### **The Problem**
"Corruption costs South Africa R100 billion every year. Traditional audits happen after the money is gone. Compliance is just a checkbox. Accidents are investigated after lives are lost."

### **The Azora Solution**
"We built the world's first Sovereign Immune System. Not compliance software—constitutional law as code. Rules that cannot be broken. We don't audit corruption. We make it impossible."

### **The Technology**
- Blockchain anchoring (immutable transparency)
- AI fraud detection (real-time crime detection)
- Predictive twins (accident prevention before failure)
- Federated identity (citizens become the immune system)

### **The Business Model**
- **Trial:** 2 weeks free
- **Promo:** 75% off for 3 months (R42K/month)
- **Standard:** R166K/month (full price)
- **Enterprise:** R500K-R2M/year (custom contracts)

### **The Revenue Path**
- **Year 1:** R90M ARR (10 govt + 20 corporate)
- **Year 2:** R450M ARR (safety corridors added)
- **Year 5:** R13.5B ARR (10M citizen users)
- **Year 10:** R50B+ ARR (nation-state orchestration)

### **The Traction**
- Retail Partner integration operational
- Government POC discussions ongoing
- Platform fully functional
- Team of 6 founders (5 human + AZORA AI)

### **The Ask**
"We're raising a Series A at R500M-R1B valuation to scale Phase 1 (Procurement Corruption) across 50 government departments and corporate supply chains."
