## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The G20 South Africa Summit represents a historic opportunity to position Azora OS as the global standard for sovereign digital infrastructure. With 19 of the world's largest economies plus the EU gathering in South Africa, we have unprecedented access to decision-makers who control 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.

**Strategic Objective:** Secure commitments from minimum 12 G20 nations to adopt Azora OS frameworks within 12 months of the summit.

**Value Proposition:** Azora offers G20 nations the world's first complete sovereign digital infrastructure - combining education economics, constitutional AI governance, and economic sovereignty in a single integrated platform.
