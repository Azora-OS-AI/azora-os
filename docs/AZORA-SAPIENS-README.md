# Azora Sapiens - The Universal Education Platform

## Overview

**Azora Sapiens** is the sentient, adaptive mind of the Azora ecosystem and the primary engine for creating future citizens. It is not merely a school; it is a revolutionary education system that transforms learning from a debilitating cost into a paid, value-creating activity.

## The Four Pillars

### Pillar 1: Curriculum Engine (Ascension Protocol) üß†
- **Global Knowledge Ingestion**: Ingests curricula from world's top universities
- **First Principles Forge**: Socratic AI tutors that deconstruct concepts to axiomatic truths
- **Curriculum Synthesis**: Autonomously generates superior, cross-disciplinary curriculum

### Pillar 2: Economic Engine (Proof-of-Knowledge) üí∞
- **Dynamic Reward Algorithm**: Real-time calculation based on NQF level, demand, and performance
- **UBO Funding**: All rewards paid from the 1% Universal Basic Opportunity Fund
- **Economic Liberation**: Transforms education from cost to paid work

### Pillar 3: Integrity Engine (Aegis Sentry) üõ°Ô∏è
- **Aegis Integrity Shield**: Camera-less protocol for on-campus exams
- **Aegis Mobile Sentry**: AI-monitored proctoring for remote assessments
- **Mathematical Guarantee**: Keystroke dynamics, screen monitoring, behavioral analysis

### Pillar 4: Partnership Engine (University Symbiosis) ü§ù
- **Pathway Partnership**: Official accelerated pathway to university degrees
- **Irresistible Offer**: Zero-cost, high-profit venture for partner universities
- **Global Legitimacy**: Graduates receive officially recognized qualifications

## Qualification Framework

### Tier 1: Azora Core Knowledge Qualification (CKQ)
- Accelerated practical qualification equivalent to SAQA standards
- Unlocks paid Proof-of-Contribution work in Azora ecosystem
- Examples: CKQ-CS (Computer Science), CKQ-Law (Law)

### Tier 2: Full University Degree
- Official university degree through partnership pathways
- Examples: B.DeSci(CS), LL.B(De)
- Zero debt, work experience, and real problem-solving portfolio

## Student Journey

1. **Open Enrollment**: Anyone enrolls through Nexus app
2. **Sprint to Earning**: Complete CKQ modules, earn aZAR rewards
3. **Unlock the Economy**: Eligible for paid Proof-of-Contribution tasks
4. **Marathon to Mastery**: Earn stable income while completing full degree
5. **Graduation**: Official degree, zero debt, work experience, sovereign citizen

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js 22+, Express.js
- **AI Core**: LangChain, Custom Socratic Reasoning Models, Causal Inference Engine
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for Global Academic Knowledge Graph
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes
