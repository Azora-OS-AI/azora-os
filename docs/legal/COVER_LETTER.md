## Introduction

This pack sets out the vision, governance, financial discipline, and agreements that will guide **Azora World (Pty) Ltd** from inception to scale. 

It is designed to:
- **Align the founding team** around our sovereign AI mission

## Our Mission

We are building **Azora OS** â€“ Africa's first autonomous, self-improving AI operating system for logistics, operations, and governance.

**Not rented AI from Silicon Valley. Not wrapped APIs. Actual AI architecture, designed and built from scratch in South Africa.**

âœ… **Compliance-First** â€“ POPIA, B-BBEE, and regulatory mapping from day one  
âœ… **Clear Roles** â€“ Each founder knows their lane and accountability  
âœ… **Exit Protection** â€“ Fair vesting, buy-back, and dispute resolution
