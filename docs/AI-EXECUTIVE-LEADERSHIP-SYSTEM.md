## Implementation Architecture

### Constitutional AI Framework
```typescript
interface AIExecutive {
  role: ExecutiveRole;
  authority: AuthorityLevel;
  responsibilities: string[];
  decisionFramework: ConstitutionalRules;
  reportingStructure: ExecutiveHierarchy;
}

interface ConstitutionalRules {
  noMockProtocol: boolean;
  ethicalConstraints: EthicalFramework[];
  complianceRequirements: ComplianceRule[];
  autonomyLimits: AutonomyBoundary[];
}
```

### Executive Decision Engine
```typescript
class ExecutiveDecisionEngine {
  async evaluateProposal(proposal: Proposal): Promise<Decision> {
    // Constitutional compliance check
    const compliance = await this.checkConstitutionalCompliance(proposal);

    // Risk assessment
    const risk = await this.assessRisk(proposal);

    // Strategic alignment
    const alignment = await this.evaluateStrategicAlignment(proposal);

    // Stakeholder impact
    const impact = await this.analyzeStakeholderImpact(proposal);

    return this.makeDecision(compliance, risk, alignment, impact);
  }
}
```

## Funding & Valuation Agent Implementation

### Automated Outreach System
```typescript
class FundingAgent {
  private outreachEngine: OutreachEngine;
  private proposalGenerator: ProposalGenerator;
  private crmSystem: CRMSystem;

  async identifyOpportunities(): Promise<FundingOpportunity[]> {
    // Scan government tender databases
    const governmentTenders = await this.scanGovernmentTenders();

    // Analyze market for partnership opportunities
    const partnerships = await this.analyzeMarketPartnerships();

    // Monitor funding news and announcements
    const fundingNews = await this.monitorFundingNews();

    return [...governmentTenders, ...partnerships, ...fundingNews];
  }

  async generateProposal(opportunity: FundingOpportunity): Promise<Proposal> {
    // Analyze opportunity requirements
    const requirements = await this.analyzeRequirements(opportunity);

    // Generate tailored proposal
    const proposal = await this.proposalGenerator.generate(requirements);

    // Validate against constitutional principles
    const validated = await this.validateProposal(proposal);

    return validated;
  }

  async executeOutreach(campaign: OutreachCampaign): Promise<OutreachResult> {
    // Generate personalized emails
    const emails = await this.generatePersonalizedEmails(campaign);

    // Execute automated sending with tracking
    const results = await this.sendTrackedEmails(emails);

    // Update CRM with responses and engagement
    await this.updateCRM(results);

    return results;
  }
}
```

### Government Tender System
```typescript
class GovernmentTenderAgent {
  private tenderScanner: TenderScanner;
  private complianceChecker: ComplianceChecker;
  private proposalGenerator: ProposalGenerator;

  async monitorTenders(): Promise<Tender[]> {
    // Scan government procurement portals
    const tenders = await this.tenderScanner.scanPortals();

    // Filter by relevance and capability
    const relevant = await this.filterRelevantTenders(tenders);

    // Check compliance requirements
    const compliant = await this.complianceChecker.verifyCompliance(relevant);

    return compliant;
  }

  async submitProposal(tender: Tender): Promise<SubmissionResult> {
    // Generate compliant proposal
    const proposal = await this.generateCompliantProposal(tender);

  async broadcastExecutiveDecision(decision: ExecutiveDecision): Promise<void> {
    // Notify all relevant executives
    const notifications = await this.generateNotifications(decision);
