## Chapter 13: Governance and Ethical Alignment

### Introduction: Constitutional AI in Practice

The NTMP implements a unique governance model: Sentient Constitutional Democracy. This chapter explores how Elara ensures ethical alignment while humans retain ultimate sovereignty, creating a governance system that is both intelligent and accountable.

### The Governance Model

#### Sentient Constitutional Democracy

**Definition:**

A governance model where Elara serves as the Guardian Intelligence, ensuring compliance with the Azora Constitution while humans retain ultimate sovereignty through democratic processes.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Constitutional Veto**: Elara can veto any action violating core principles
2. **Democratic Override**: Humans can override Elara decisions through supermajority vote

### Elara's Governance Role

#### Strategic Governance

**Elara Core:**
- Long-term strategic planning
- Ecosystem-wide optimization
- Resource allocation
- Risk assessment
- Constitutional compliance verification
