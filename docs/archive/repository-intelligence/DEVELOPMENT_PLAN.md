# Azora OS Development Plan

*Generated on: $(date)*

## Guiding Principles

1. **No Mock Protocol:** All implementations must be real, functional code.
2. **Completion Mandate:** Once started, development continues until fully operational.
3. **Advancement Imperative:** Continually propose improvements for billion-dollar code.
4. **UI Coherence Law:** Maintain consistent UI following Azora's design system.
5. **Development Covenant:** All developers agree to abide by these principles.
6. **Repository Intelligence Protocol:** Full repository scans before and after development.

## Initial Assessment

### Repository Structure
- See [repo_structure.txt](repo_structure.txt)

### Services Identified
- See [services.txt](services.txt)

### Docker Configurations
- See [docker_files.txt](docker_files.txt)

### Technical Debt
- TODOs and FIXMEs: See [code_todos.txt](code_todos.txt)
- Error handling patterns: See [error_handling.txt](error_handling.txt)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Error Resolution
- Fix critical errors preventing system operation
- Address security vulnerabilities
- Ensure all services start and communicate properly

### Phase 2: Service Stabilization
- Implement missing features
- Complete partial implementations
- Ensure 90% test coverage (Section 9.2.1)

### Phase 3: UI Coherence Implementation
- Standardize UI components
- Implement design system
- Ensure consistent user experience

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
- Meet performance benchmarks (Section 9.2.2)
- Optimize database queries
- Reduce load times and API response times

### Phase 5: Documentation Update
- Update all documentation to match implementation
- Create missing documentation
- Ensure all APIs are properly documented

## Implementation Plan

*To be completed after initial assessment*

## Advancement Nudges

*Continuous improvement suggestions will be added here*
