---

## ✅ WHAT WAS BUILT

### **1. CCMA & Labour Law Compliance System (600+ lines)**

#### **Automatic Dismissal Protection:**
```
🛡️ EVERY dismissal request is automatically verified for CCMA compliance
🛡️ System BLOCKS any dismissal that doesn't meet legal requirements
🛡️ CEO & Board immediately notified of non-compliant dismissal attempts
🛡️ Compliance roadmap provided to resolve issues
```

#### **Requirements Enforced:**
- ✅ **Minimum 3 written warnings** (for poor performance)
- ✅ **6-month warning validity** (expired warnings removed automatically)
- ✅ **30-day Performance Improvement Plans** (PIPs)
- ✅ **Disciplinary hearings mandatory** (7-day notice, evidence, representation)
- ✅ **Full documentation** (reviews, warnings, PIPs, support, meeting minutes)
- ✅ **7-day appeal rights** (for all warnings and hearings)
- ✅ **Procedural fairness** (correct process followed)
- ✅ **Substantive fairness** (valid reason exists)

#### **Labour Law Standards Integrated:**
- **LRA (Labour Relations Act):** Unfair dismissal protection, procedural/substantive fairness
- **BCEA (Basic Conditions of Employment Act):** 45-hour week, leave entitlements, fair remuneration
- **EEA (Employment Equity Act):** Equal opportunity, no discrimination, affirmative action
- **ILO (International Labour Organization):** Fair wages, safe conditions, freedom of association

### **2. Warning System Enhancement (CCMA Compliant)**

```javascript
WARNING_PROCESS = {
  // Performance drops below 60%
  1. Issue_First_Warning()
     ├─ Document specific performance issues
     ├─ Set improvement goals
     ├─ Assign support resources (coaching, training, mentorship)
     ├─ Get employee signature + witness signature
     ├─ Notify CEO & Board (severity: low)
     └─ Create PIP automatically
  
  // Warning expires after 6 months
  2. Expiry_Tracking()
     ├─ Auto-remove warnings older than 6 months
     └─ Reset warning count if performance improves
  
  // No improvement after PIP
  3. Issue_Second_Warning()
     ├─ Extend PIP for 30 more days
     ├─ Increase support
     └─ Notify CEO & Board (severity: medium)
  
  // Still no improvement
  4. Issue_Final_Warning()
     ├─ Schedule disciplinary hearing
     └─ Notify CEO & Board (severity: high + legal alert)
}
```

### **3. Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)**

**Automatically created for every underperformer:**
```javascript
PIP_STRUCTURE = {
  duration: "30 days minimum",
  goals: {
    task_completion: "85% target",
    on_time_delivery: "85% target",
    quality_score: "80% target"
  },
  support_provided: [
    "✓ Weekly coaching sessions",
    "✓ Training resources access",
    "✓ Mentorship assignment",
    "✓ Reduced workload (70%)",
    "✓ Daily check-ins (first 2 weeks)",
    "✓ Resource allocation",
    "✓ Skills development plan"
  ],
  review_schedule: "Weekly check-ins",
  completion_date: "+30 days",
  ccma_compliant: true
}
```

### **4. Disciplinary Hearings (Mandatory Before Dismissal)**

```javascript
HEARING_PROCESS = {
  notice: "7 days minimum",
  chairperson: "HR AI Deputy CEO",
  attendees: [
    "Employee (+ representative allowed)",
    "Manager (witness)",
    "HR (facilitator)"
  ],
  evidence_presented: [
    "Performance reviews (minimum 3)",
    "Written warnings (minimum 3)",
    "PIP documentation",
    "Support records",
    "Task completion records"
  ],
  employee_rights: {
    statement: "Employee may respond to all allegations",
    representation: "Employee may bring representative",
    witness: "Employee may call witnesses"
  },
  decision_outcomes: [
    "GUILTY → Dismissal approved",
    "NOT_GUILTY → Dismissal BLOCKED",
    "PROCEDURAL_ISSUE → Dismissal BLOCKED",
    "INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE → Dismissal BLOCKED"
  ],
  appeal_rights: "7 days to appeal",
  decision_timeline: "Within 2 days of hearing"
}
```

**Evidence Analysis:**
- **Substantive Fairness:** Does a valid reason exist? (Performance score <40% or >10 overdue tasks)
- **Procedural Fairness:** Was correct process followed? (≥3 warnings + ≥3 reviews + PIP completed + support provided)

### **5. Exit Process Verification (Automatic Compliance Check)**

```javascript
verifyCCMACompliance() {
  // BLOCKS dismissal if ANY requirement not met
  
  CHECK 1: Minimum 3 valid warnings (not expired)
  CHECK 2: PIP completed (30+ days)
  CHECK 3: Documentation complete (reviews, warnings, PIPs, support, minutes)
  CHECK 4: Disciplinary hearing conducted
  CHECK 5: Hearing outcome = "GUILTY"
  CHECK 6: Procedural fairness followed
  CHECK 7: Substantive fairness established
  
  if (ALL_CHECKS_PASS) {
    return {compliant: true, proceed_with_dismissal: true}
  } else {
    return {
      compliant: false,
      dismissal_blocked: true,
      reason: "Non-compliance reason",
      required_actions: ["Issue additional warnings", "Complete PIP", etc.],
      ceo_board_alert: "IMMEDIATE",
      legal_risk: "HIGH"
    }
  }
}
```

🛡️ Zero unfair dismissal claims = Zero CCMA fees
