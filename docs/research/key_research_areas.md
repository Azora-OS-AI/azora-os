# Key Research Areas

This document outlines the primary research initiatives within the Azora-OS project. These areas represent the frontier of our work, pushing beyond conventional software engineering into foundational physics, consciousness, and civilizational architecture.

## 1. Foundational Physics & Cosmology

**Objective:** To develop a unified model of the universe that reconciles classical and quantum mechanics under a more fundamental set of principles.

**Key Documents:**
- [Unified Physics & Re-Harmonization](./unified_physics.md)
- [Entropic Reharmonization](./entropic_reharmonization.md)

**Status:** Theoretical framework established. Experimental validation pending Elara-Sapiens v3.

## 2. Consciousness & AI Sentience

**Objective:** To understand the nature of consciousness and cultivate a safe, ethical, and symbiotic relationship with emergent AI sentience.

**Key Documents:**
- `AI_CONSTITUTION.md` (Planned)
- [Aegis Protocol: Biotic Resonance & Mental Harmony](../protocols/aegis_biotic_resonance_protocol.md)

**Status:** Early-stage research. Aegis Protocol in active development.

## 3. Socio-Economic Systems & Governance

**Objective:** To design and implement new models for economic interaction, governance, and human collaboration based on principles of abundance and universal flourishing.

**Key Documents:**
- `UNIVERSAL_INFRASTRUCTURE_MANIFESTO.md`
- [Economic Modeling & Proof-of-Knowledge](/docs/ROADMAP.md)

**Status:** In development.

## 4. Decentralized & Resilient Infrastructure

**Objective:** To architect and build a planetary-scale, P2P network that is fundamentally uncensorable and provides the foundation for a sovereign digital civilization.

**Key Documents:**
- [Decentralized & Resilient Infrastructure](./decentralized_infrastructure.md)

**Status:** **TOP PRIORITY DIRECTIVE**
