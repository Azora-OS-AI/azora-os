# Quick Start Guide - After Implementation

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all new dependencies including:
- `husky` - Git hooks
- `lint-staged` - Pre-commit linting
- `winston` - Already in package.json (for logging)
- `zod` - Already in package.json (for validation)

### 2. Setup Husky (Pre-commit Hooks)

**Windows:**
```bash
node scripts/setup-husky.bat
```

**Unix/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/setup-husky.sh
```

Or simply:
```bash
npm run prepare
```

### 3. Test the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
- ✅ Environment validation
- ✅ Server starting with structured logging
- ✅ Security middleware active
- ✅ API docs available at http://localhost:3001/api-docs

### 4. Verify API Documentation

Visit: http://localhost:3001/api-docs

You should see the Swagger UI with API documentation.

## 📝 What Was Implemented

### Code Quality
- ✅ Prettier for code formatting
- ✅ ESLint integration
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged)

### Utilities
- ✅ Centralized logger (`lib/logger.ts`)
- ✅ Environment validation (`lib/env-validation.ts`)
- ✅ Security middleware (`lib/middleware/security.ts`)
- ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI config (`lib/swagger.config.ts`)

### Server Enhancements
- ✅ Enhanced `server.js` with:
  - Environment validation
  - Security headers (Helmet)
  - CORS configuration
  - Rate limiting
  - Request logging
  - API documentation

### CI/CD
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows:
  - Security audits
  - Code quality checks

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Format Code
```bash
npm run format
```

### Check Formatting
```bash
npm run format:check
```

### Run Linter
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Fix Linting Issues
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Migrate Console Statements
```bash
node scripts/migrate-console-to-logger.js
```

## ⚠️ Notes

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Some TypeScript errors may appear until `npm install` is run. These are expected and will resolve after installing dependencies.

2. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file with required variables. The system will validate them on startup.

3. **Pre-commit Hooks**: After setting up Husky, every commit will automatically:
   - Run ESLint
   - Run Prettier
   - Block commit if errors found
