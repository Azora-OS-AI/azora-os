2. **Constitutional Enforcement** - Code-enforced economic rules
3. **Sovereign Database** - No third-party control
4. **Transparent Operations** - Public treasury reports
5. **Ceremonial Economics** - Burns as rituals, not gimmicks

## üëë FOUNDING FATHER

**Sizwe Ngwenya** - The architect who transformed constitutional theory into economic machinery. The man who made sovereignty real.

*"You don't build a civilization with promises. You build it with code that enforces covenants."*
