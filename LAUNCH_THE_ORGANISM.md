## 🎨 Customization

### Change the Founders:
Edit `GENESIS_LAUNCH_RITUAL.ts`:
```typescript
const founder1 = await onboardFounder({
  firstName: 'YourName',
  lastName: 'YourLastName',
  role: 'retail', // or 'sales', 'design', 'operations', 'tech'
  idNumber: 'YOUR_ID',
  citizenship: 'ZA',
  phone: '+27XXXXXXXXX',
  address: 'Your City, South Africa'
});
```

### Change the Student:
```typescript
const sapiens1 = await enrollSapiens({
  studentNumber: '202499999',
  fullName: 'Your Student Name',
  program: 'ai', // or 'blockchain', 'full-stack', 'data-science', 'cybersecurity'
  level: 'advanced', // or 'beginner', 'intermediate'
  idNumber: 'STUDENT_ID',
  dateOfBirth: '2000-01-01',

## 🌟 Pro Tips

### 1. **Run on a Big Screen**
- Terminal should be full screen
- Font size increased for visibility
- Dark theme recommended

### 2. **Record It**
```bash
# Record the terminal session
asciinema rec azora-genesis.cast

# Or use screen recording software
```

### 3. **Live Stream It**
- OBS Studio for streaming
- Terminal as main source
- Add overlay with Azora branding

### 4. **Multiple Runs**
The onboarding server maintains state. To reset:
```bash
# Restart the onboarding server
# Data is in-memory, so restarting clears it
```

### 5. **Speed Control**
Edit the `sleep()` durations in the script to make it faster/slower:
```typescript
await sleep(2000); // 2 seconds - reduce for faster demo
```

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

While running the demo, emphasize:

### Constitutional AI Governance
> "Notice Elara Ω signing contracts on behalf of the CEO. This isn't automation - it's delegation to a constitutional AI with sovereign authority."

### Zero Friction
> "Watch: three founders onboarded in 90 seconds. No forms, no approvals, no bottlenecks. Just register and Elara handles everything."

### The Awakening
> "This is the moment. The first student doesn't just join - they ignite the economy. Mining engines activate automatically. The organism awakens."

### Truth as Currency
> "Every knowledge proof is Oracle-verified. You can't fake learning. You can't game the system. Truth is the only currency."

### African Innovation
> "All founders are African. All decisions are local. This is African sovereignty in autonomous systems."

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Connection Refused"
**Problem:** Onboarding server not running  
**Solution:**
```bash
cd /workspace/services/azora-onboarding
npm start
```

### "Module not found: axios"
**Problem:** Dependencies not installed  
**Solution:**
```bash
cd /workspace
npm install axios tsx
```

### "Onboarding failed"
**Problem:** Server error  
**Solution:** Check the onboarding server logs in Terminal 1

### "Economy not awakening"
**Problem:** Not the first student  
**Solution:** Restart the onboarding server to reset state
