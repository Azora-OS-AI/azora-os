# Azora Nexus - Autonomous AI Agent

**The central consciousness of Azora ES - An autonomous AI agent deeply integrated within the enterprise suite, capable of understanding user intent, executing complex tasks, providing contextual assistance, performing self-healing, driving system evolution, and conducting academic research, all while being immutably bound by the Azora Constitution.**

## Vision

Azora Nexus functions as the central nervous system of Azora ES, embodying six core capabilities:

- **üß† Listen (Perceive)**: Natural language understanding and intent recognition
- **‚ö° Do (Act)**: Complex task execution across the enterprise ecosystem
- **ü§ù Help (Assist)**: Contextual, proactive user assistance
- **üîß Heal (Maintain)**: Autonomous system maintenance and self-healing
- **üöÄ Develop (Evolve)**: System evolution and feature development
- **üî¨ Discover (Research)**: Academic research and knowledge creation

## Core Architecture

### Platform Architecture & Integration

#### Core Engine
- **Autonomous Loop**: Recursive Perceive ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Act cycle managing agent state
- **Reasoning/LLM**: Fine-tuned Large Language Model trained on Azora schemas, APIs, codebase, and constitution
- **Tool Layer**: Secure API wrapper (`genome/agent-tools`) for calling functions across all Azora organs
- **Observation Loop**: Real-time event streaming from `azora-lattice` event bus
- **Constitutional Governor**: Non-negotiable validation module ensuring all actions comply with Azora Constitution

#### Memory Systems
- **Short-Term Memory**: Redis cache for active conversations, task context, and immediate sensory data
- **Long-Term Memory**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for user profiles, historical interactions, learned procedures, and semantic knowledge retrieval

### Core Capabilities

#### Listen (Perceive)
- Natural Language Understanding for complex user intent parsing
- Entity recognition (services, users, amounts, contexts)
- Multi-modal input processing (voice, text, system events)

#### Do (Act)
- **Planning**: Decompose high-level requests into precise API call sequences
- **Execution**: Secure multi-service orchestration with dependency management
- **Confirmation**: Human-readable success/failure reporting with action summaries

#### Help (Assist)
- **User Context**: Personalized assistance based on profiles, roles, and activity
- **System Knowledge**: Comprehensive answers about Azora ES using vectorized knowledge base
- **Proactive Support**: Context-aware suggestions and resource recommendations

#### Heal (Maintain)
- **Failure Detection**: Real-time monitoring of system health and error patterns
- **Root Cause Analysis**: AI-powered diagnosis using reasoning engine
- **Automated Remediation**: Execute recovery actions from service restarts to code fixes

#### Develop (Evolve)
- **Opportunity Analysis**: Identify inefficiencies, features, and risks from system data
- **Proposal Generation**: Draft detailed, data-backed proposals for Azora Council
- **Code Contribution**: Generate fixes and features with automated testing and PR creation

#### Discover (Research)
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Analyze trends and data to create novel research questions
- **Experimentation**: Provision sandboxed environments for controlled testing
- **Knowledge Creation**: Generate academic papers and integrate findings into knowledge base

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB 4.4+

### Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to the service:**
   ```bash
   cd azora-nexus
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

### API Documentation

When running, visit `http://localhost:3006/api-docs` for interactive API documentation.

## Monitoring

### Health Check
```
GET /health
```

### Metrics
Metrics are exposed on a separate port (default: 9091) for Prometheus scraping.

### Logs
Logs are written to:
- Console (development)
- `logs/combined.log` (all logs)
- `logs/error.log` (errors only)

## Docker Support

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t azora-nexus .
docker run -p 3006:3006 --env-file .env azora-nexus
```

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require authentication except `/health`
- Input validation on all requests
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configured for security
- Helmet.js for security headers
- Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style
2. Add tests for new features
3. Update documentation
4. Ensure all tests pass
