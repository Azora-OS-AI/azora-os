# üèÜ NOBEL PEACE PRIZE NOMINATION 2026

**Nominee:** AZORA World (Pty) Ltd  
**Innovation:** Federated Conflict Resolution Engine (FCRE)  
**Tagline:** *"Architecting Peace Through Code"*

---

## üìã NOMINATION SUMMARY

We nominate **AZORA World** for the **2026 Nobel Peace Prize** for developing the **Federated Conflict Resolution Engine (FCRE)** ‚Äî a groundbreaking technology platform that makes peace **scalable, transparent, and participatory** through artificial intelligence, blockchain immutability, and federated governance.

---

## üéØ THE PROBLEM

Traditional conflict resolution suffers from:

1. **Slow Process** - Disputes take 18+ months to resolve
2. **Opacity** - Lack of transparency breeds distrust
3. **Power Asymmetries** - Weaker parties are disadvantaged
4. **High Costs** - Legal fees and economic losses are prohibitive
5. **Limited Scalability** - Mediation doesn't scale to global conflicts
6. **No Auditability** - Disputes about "what was agreed"

**Result:** Conflicts escalate, trade is disrupted, wars erupt, billions are lost.

---

## üí° THE SOLUTION: AZORA FCRE

A **Nobel-grade conflict resolution engine** with 5 architectural layers:

### **1. Ontology Layer**
- Conflict taxonomy (trade, border, humanitarian, cyber, climate)
- Actor graphs (power dynamics, relationships, interests)
- Intent modeling (underlying interests vs stated positions)

### **2. Protocol Layer**
- Federated mediation protocols (arbitration, negotiation, restorative justice)
- Compliance hooks (AU, UN, WTO, ICC, SADC)
- Immutable audit trails (blockchain-anchored)

### **3. AI Reasoning Layer**
- Multi-agent simulation (outcome modeling, escalation risks)
- Ethical reasoners (fairness, proportionality, precedent)
- Narrative reconciliation (translate divergent truths into shared understanding)

### **4. Trust & Reputation Layer**
- Reputation economies (weight actor credibility, historical behavior)
- Verifier mesh (distributed validators - civil society, regulators, observers)
- Zero-knowledge proofs (privacy-preserving evidence sharing)

### **5. Interface Layer**
- Voice-native copilot (for diplomats, ministers, field agents)
- Conflict dashboard (live status, risk scores, resolution paths)
- Mediator runbooks (guided resolution workflows)

---
