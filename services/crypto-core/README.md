# Crypto Core

Core cryptographic primitives and consensus algorithms for Azora OS.

## Overview

Crypto Core provides the foundational cryptographic infrastructure for Azora OS, including quantum-resistant cryptography and multi-dimensional consensus mechanisms.

## Features

### Quantum-Resistant Cryptography
Located in `src/primitives/quantum-resistant.ts`:
- Post-quantum cryptographic primitives
- Quantum-resistant key generation
- Secure communication protocols

### Multi-Dimensional Consensus
Located in `src/consensus/multi-dimensional-consensus.ts`:
- Advanced consensus algorithms
- Multi-dimensional agreement protocols
- Byzantine fault tolerance
