The development plan for the main entry point: azora.world. 

Vision: The primary public-facing portal for Azora OS, serving as the "front door" to the ecosystem. It introduces the Azora vision, guides users to relevant services (subdomains), provides high-level ecosystem insights, facilitates user onboarding (signup/login), and communicates key news and updates.

1. Platform Architecture Overview 

Frontend: synapse/main-ui (React/Next.js + Tailwind) -> Deployed to azora.world 

Backend: Potentially minimal initially (e.g., Node.js/Express for contact forms, redirects) or could be a Static Site Generation (SSG) setup using Next.js for performance. As dynamic features are added (like stats from Pulse), a light backend or serverless functions will be needed. 

Database: PostgreSQL (optional initially, maybe for storing contact form submissions, user preferences, or newsletter signups). 

Auth Service: Azora Identity (OAuth2 / JWT) - Crucial integration for Login/Signup buttons and redirecting authenticated users. 

Analytics Service: Azora Pulse (Future Integration) - To display high-level, anonymized ecosystem stats. 

Notification Service: Azora Notifications (Optional) - For newsletter signups or contact form confirmations. 

Content Management System (CMS): (Optional, but recommended for scalability) - Headless CMS (like Strapi, Contentful, or a simple Markdown-based one) to manage landing page content, news, and service descriptions without code changes. 

 

2. Core Features & Modules 

A. Landing Page / Homepage 

Hero Section: Clear, concise headline communicating the Azora vision (e.g., "Build the Future, Compliantly. Africa's First Full Software Infrastructure."). Strong call-to-action (CTA) like "Get Started" or "Explore Services." High-quality visuals/animations reflecting the brand. 

Value Proposition: Sections clearly explaining what Azora OS is, who it's for (Students, Developers, Enterprises), and why it's different (AI, Compliance, Ecosystem). 

Service Overview: Visually appealing section briefly introducing the core pillars/subdomains (Forge, Mint, Scriptorium, Aegis, Logistics, etc.) with icons and short descriptions, linking to each subdomain. 

Key Features/Benefits: Highlight unique aspects like "Mint Your Credit," "AI-Powered Compliance," "Resilient Cloud," "Learn & Earn." 

Trust/Credibility: (Eventually) Logos of partners or pilot customers, testimonials, key stats from Azora Pulse. 

Call-to-Action: Repeated CTAs throughout the page (e.g., "Sign Up Free," "Request Enterprise Demo"). 

B. Ecosystem Navigation 

Main Header: Logo, clear navigation links (e.g., Services, For Students, For Enterprise, Developers, About, Contact), Login/Signup buttons. 

Footer: Sitemap links, legal links (Privacy Policy, Terms), contact info, social media links. 

Dedicated "Services" Page: A more detailed directory of all Azora subdomains/services with descriptions and links. 

C. User Onboarding Entry Point 

Signup Button: Links to Azora Identity registration flow. 

Login Button: Links to Azora Identity login flow. 

Post-Login Redirect Logic: After successful login via Azora Identity, the backend/frontend logic should ideally redirect the user to the most relevant dashboard based on their role or recent activity (e.g., student to learn.azora.world, enterprise admin to enterprise.azora.world). 

D. Static Content Pages 

About Us: Mission, Vision, Team (optional), Constitutional Principles. 

Contact: Contact form (needs backend handler), email address, physical address (if applicable). 

Privacy Policy & Terms of Service: Essential legal pages. 

E. News/Blog Section (Optional V1.1+) 

Simple blog/update feed managed via CMS. 

Announcements, new feature releases, ecosystem news. 

F. High-Level Ecosystem Stats (Future Integration) 

A section on the homepage displaying simple, anonymized, real-time stats pulled from Azora Pulse (e.g., "Active Users," "AZR Minted Today," "Courses Completed"). Needs careful design for privacy and performance. 

### Ecosystem Stats Dashboard
- Page: `/ecosystem-stats`
- API: `/api/pulse`
- Shows: Active Users, AZR Minted Today, Courses Completed
- Integrates with Azora Pulse (real-time stats engine)

3. Database Schema (PostgreSQL - Optional/Minimal) 

ContactSubmissions: id, name, email, message, timestamp 

NewsletterSignups: id, email, subscribed_at 

(If using DB for basic user prefs) UserPreferences: user_id, preferred_dashboard (e.g., 'learn', 'enterprise') 

 

4. Development Milestones 

Phase 1: Static Landing & Core Pages MVP 

Design and build the main landing page structure (Hero, Value Prop, Service Overview sections) with static content. 

Build basic "About" and "Contact" pages (with working form submission). 

Implement Header/Footer navigation. 

Integrate Login/Signup buttons linking to Azora Identity. 

Deploy azora.world using SSG (e.g., Next.js export) for performance. 

Phase 2: Service Directory & Basic CMS 

Build the dedicated "Services" page. 

Integrate a simple Headless CMS for managing homepage content and service descriptions. 

Phase 3: Post-Login Redirect Logic 

Implement the logic to intelligently redirect users after login based on their role/data from Azora Identity. 

Phase 4: Dynamic Content & Pulse Integration 

(Requires Azora Pulse to be ready) Integrate the display of high-level, anonymized ecosystem stats. 

Build the News/Blog section if desired. 

 

5. Tech Stack 

Frontend: React, Next.js (recommended for SSG/SSR performance and SEO), TailwindCSS. 

Backend (If needed): Node.js/Express or Serverless Functions (Vercel/Netlify Functions, AWS Lambda) for contact forms, simple API endpoints. 

Database (If needed): PostgreSQL. 

CMS (Optional): Strapi, Contentful, Sanity, KeystoneJS, or Markdown-based. 

Auth: Azora Identity (Integration via redirects/callbacks). 

Analytics: Standard web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible). Internal analytics via Azora Pulse later. 

DevOps: Docker (for backend/CMS if needed), GitHub Actions, Vercel (ideal for Next.js frontend). 

 

6. Security & Compliance 

Standard Web Security: HTTPS enforced, protection against XSS, CSRF (especially for forms). 

POPIA: Ensure Privacy Policy is accurate and compliant regarding any data collected (e.g., contact forms, analytics). Consent needed for newsletters. 

Auth Integration Security: Use standard, secure OAuth2/OIDC flows for integrating with Azora Identity. 

 

7. Monitoring & SEO 

Uptime Monitoring: Basic uptime checks. 

Web Analytics: Track visits, bounce rates, page views, referral sources. 

SEO: Implement basic Search Engine Optimization best practices (meta tags, semantic HTML, sitemap) - crucial for discoverability. Next.js helps with this. 

This plan ensures azora.world serves as a professional, informative, and effective entry point to the entire Azora OS ecosystem, guiding users and clearly communicating the vision from day one.
