```javascript
Metrics tracked:
- Task Completion Rate (35% weight)
- On-Time Delivery Rate (25% weight)
- Quality Score (25% weight)
- Collaboration Score (15% weight)

Overall Score = weighted average
```

### **2. Automated Actions:**
```javascript
if (score >= 0.95) {
  grantAchievement('exceptional_performance');
  grantBonus();
}

if (score < 0.60) {
  issueWarning();
  createImprovementPlan(30 days);
}

if (score < 0.40) {

}
```

### **3. Task Deadlines:**
```javascript
- Daily tasks: 1-day deadline
- Weekly tasks: 7-day deadline
- Monthly tasks: 30-day deadline
- Quarterly tasks: 90-day deadline

If missed: impacts performance score
If 3 consecutive misses: warning issued
If 5 consecutive misses: exit consideration
```

### **4. AI Reviews (Every 24 Hours):**
```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  employees.forEach(employee => {
    const metrics = calculatePerformanceMetrics(employee);
    const review = conductPerformanceReview(employee, metrics);
    
    if (metrics.overallScore < 0.40) {
      initiateExitProcess(employee, 'poor_performance');
    } else if (metrics.overallScore < 0.60) {
      issueWarning(employee, metrics);
    } else if (metrics.overallScore >= 0.95) {
