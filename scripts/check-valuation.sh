# --- Azora OS Trillion-Dollar Valuation Model ---
# This script models the key metrics required to achieve a trillion-dollar ecosystem valuation.
# All figures are hypothetical assumptions for modeling purposes.

# --- Colors for Output ---
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
CYAN='\033[0;36m'
NC='\033[0m'

# --- Foundational Constants (from AzoraCoin.sol) ---
AZR_MAX_SUPPLY=1000000

# --- Hypothetical High-Adoption Scenario ---
# These are the metrics Azora OS would need to hit or exceed.

# 1. Azora Coin (AZR) Metrics
# To justify a high token price, AZR must be essential for a massive economy.
# Let's assume it reaches a value comparable to a major tech stock or digital asset.
PRICE_PER_AZR=200000 # Assumption: $200,000 per AZR token

# 2. Ecosystem Metrics (Value of apps on the OS)
# The OS becomes the default platform for a new wave of sovereign applications.
NUM_APPS=5000              # Assumption: 5,000 active applications
AVG_APP_VALUE=50000000     # Assumption: Average app valuation of $50 million

# 3. Network Revenue Metrics (Value from transaction fees)
# The network processes a volume of transactions similar to a major payment network.
DAILY_TRANSACTIONS=200000000 # Assumption: 200 million daily transactions
AVG_TX_FEE_USD=0.10          # Assumption: Average fee of $0.10 per transaction
NETWORK_PE_RATIO=25          # Assumption: A Price-to-Earnings ratio for valuing the network's revenue stream
