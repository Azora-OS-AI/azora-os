## PIVC CALCULATOR

### Formula

```
Equity Earned = (Task Weight × Completion %) × Verification Factor

Where:
- Task Weight = Allocated equity % for task
- Completion % = 0-100% based on evidence
- Verification Factor = 0.5 (disputed) to 1.0 (fully verified)
```

### Examples

**Example 1: Full Completion**
```
Task: Generate R100k revenue (1.5% equity)
Evidence: R120k in bank statements
Completion: 120% (capped at 100%)
Verification: 1.0 (fully verified)
Equity Earned = 1.5% × 100% × 1.0 = 1.5% ✅
```

**Example 2: Partial Completion**
```
Task: Close 10 customers (1.5% equity)
Evidence: 6 customers closed
Completion: 60%
Verification: 1.0 (fully verified)
Equity Earned = 1.5% × 60% × 1.0 = 0.9% ✅
```

**Example 3: Disputed Evidence**
```
Task: Build sales pipeline R1M (1.5% equity)
Evidence: CRM shows R800k pipeline
Completion: 80%
Verification: 0.7 (some deals questionable)
Equity Earned = 1.5% × 80% × 0.7 = 0.84% ⚠️
```
