### 2. Network Effects (Metcalfe's Law)

```
Value ‚àù n¬≤

Where n = number of users

At 1,000 users: Value = 1,000¬≤ = 1,000,000
At 1,000,000 users: Value = (1,000,000)¬≤ = 1,000,000,000,000

Each new user increases network value exponentially.
```

- SaaS: 10-20x revenue
- Marketplace: 5-10x revenue
