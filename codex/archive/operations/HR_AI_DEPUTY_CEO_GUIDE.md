## ⚖️ CCMA & LABOUR LAW COMPLIANCE

### **Overview:**
The HR AI Deputy CEO is **fully compliant** with South African labour laws and international standards, **automatically blocking** any dismissal that doesn't meet CCMA requirements. This protects the company from unfair dismissal claims and CCMA fees.

### **CCMA Compliance Module:**

#### **1. Warning System (Minimum 3 Warnings Required)**
```javascript
WARNING_REQUIREMENTS = {
  minimum_warnings: 3,
  validity_period: 6 months,  // Warnings expire after 6 months
  documentation: {
    employee_signature: required,
    witness_signature: required,
    appeal_rights: "7 days to appeal",
    specific_examples: required,
    improvement_required: required
  },
  ceo_board_notification: automatic
}
```

**Automated Process:**
1. Performance drops below 60% → First Warning issued
2. Warning documented with employee acknowledgement
3. CEO & Board notified automatically (severity: low/medium/high)
4. Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) created automatically
5. Support resources assigned (coaching, training, mentorship)
6. Weekly check-ins scheduled
7. Warning expires after 6 months if performance improves

#### **2. Performance Improvement Plans (PIP)**
```javascript
PIP_REQUIREMENTS = {
  duration: 30 days minimum,
  goals: {
    task_completion: 0.85,      // 85% target
    on_time_delivery: 0.85,     // 85% target
    quality_score: 0.80         // 80% target
  },
  support: [
    "Weekly coaching sessions",
    "Training resources access",
    "Mentorship assignment",
    "Reduced workload (70%)",
    "Daily check-ins (first 2 weeks)"
  ],
  review_schedule: "Weekly",
  completion_date: "+30 days"
}
```

**Automated Actions:**
- PIP created automatically after first warning
- Goals tailored to employee's role and performance gaps
- Support resources assigned based on needs analysis
- Progress tracked weekly
- CEO & Board receive weekly PIP status reports

#### **3. Disciplinary Hearings (Mandatory Before Dismissal)**
```javascript
HEARING_REQUIREMENTS = {
  notice_period: 7 days,
  chairperson: "HR AI Deputy CEO",
  attendees: [
    {role: "Employee", representation_allowed: true},
    {role: "Manager", witness: true},
    {role: "HR", facilitator: true}
  ],
  evidence_provided: [
    "Performance reviews (minimum 3)",
    "Written warnings (minimum 3)",
    "PIP documentation",
    "Support records",
    "Task completion records"
  ],
  employee_rights: {
    statement: "Employee may respond to all allegations",
    representation: "Employee may bring representative",
    appeal: "7 days to appeal decision"
  },
  decision_timeline: "Within 2 days of hearing",
  ccma_compliant: true
}
```

**Hearing Process:**
1. 7-day notice sent to employee
2. All evidence compiled and presented
3. Employee given opportunity to respond
4. Evidence analyzed for substantive fairness (valid reason exists)
5. Process reviewed for procedural fairness (correct process followed)
6. Decision made: Guilty / Procedural Issue / Not Guilty / Insufficient Evidence
7. If "Guilty" → Dismissal approved
8. If any other outcome → Dismissal BLOCKED
9. Decision documented with appeal rights
10. CEO & Board notified of outcome

#### **4. Exit Process Verification (Automated Compliance Check)**
```javascript
EXIT_BLOCKED_IF = {
  warnings_insufficient: warnings < 3,
  pip_incomplete: pip_not_completed,
  hearing_not_conducted: hearing_required && !hearing_done,
  documentation_incomplete: required_docs_missing,
  procedural_fairness_violated: process_not_followed,
  substantive_fairness_not_established: no_valid_reason,
  hearing_outcome_not_guilty: hearing.outcome !== "guilty"
}

COMPLIANCE_CHECK_RESULT = {
  compliant: boolean,
  reason: "Non-compliance reason if blocked",
  required_actions: [
    "Issue additional warnings",
    "Complete PIP",
    "Conduct disciplinary hearing",
    "Gather additional documentation"
  ],
  ceo_board_alert: immediate
}
```

**Automated Protection:**
- Every dismissal request triggers `verifyCCMACompliance()`
- System automatically checks:
  * Minimum 3 valid warnings (not expired)
  * PIP completed (30 days minimum)
  * Disciplinary hearing conducted
  * All documentation complete
  * Procedural fairness followed
  * Substantive fairness established
- If ANY requirement not met → **Dismissal BLOCKED**
- CEO & Board immediately notified with compliance roadmap
- Legal risk alert issued

### **CEO & Board Notification System:**

All critical HR actions automatically notify CEO and Board:
```javascript
NOTIFICATION_TRIGGERS = {
  warnings: {
    first_warning: {severity: "low", notify: "CEO + Board"},
    second_warning: {severity: "medium", notify: "CEO + Board"},
    third_warning: {severity: "high", notify: "CEO + Board + Legal"}
  },
  dismissals: {
    blocked_dismissal: {severity: "critical", notify: "CEO + Board + Legal"},
    approved_dismissal: {severity: "high", notify: "CEO + Board"}
  },
  hearings: {
    hearing_scheduled: {severity: "high", notify: "CEO + Board"},
    hearing_outcome: {severity: "high", notify: "CEO + Board"}
  },
  recruitment: {
    strong_candidate: {score: "≥80%", notify: "CEO + Board"}
  },
  compensation: {
    urgent_increase: {risk: "high", notify: "CEO + Board + Finance"}
  }
}
```

### **Compliance Monitoring & Reporting:**

```javascript
COMPLIANCE_METRICS = {
  daily_checks: [
    "Warnings expiry (6-month validity)",
    "PIP completion (30-day minimum)",
    "Hearing notice (7-day minimum)",
    "Documentation completeness"
  ],
  monthly_reports: {
    warnings_issued: count,
    pips_active: count,
    hearings_conducted: count,
    dismissals: {total, ccma_compliant_percentage},
    unfair_dismissal_claims: target_zero,
    compensation_equity: percentage,
    recruitment_diversity: score
  },
  legal_risk_score: calculated_automatically
}
```

  compensation_award: "Up to 12 months salary",
  reinstatement: "Possible",
  reputational_damage: "High",
