- The system shall provide open APIs and export tools, so reputation can empower its owner anywhere.

## Article II: Citizens Own Their Data, Story, and Upside

- Each user is a sovereign citizen—not a product. Their data, profile, and reputation belong to them, not to Azora or any third party.
- Azora’s architecture shall guarantee exportability, privacy, and user-driven permissioning at every layer.
- No entity may tamper with, sell, or obscure user data or reputation without explicit, revocable consent.

## Article III: Simulation and Foresight Are Rights

- Every citizen may access predictions and scenario modeling for their actions—be it a trip, contract, or negotiation.
- Azora will provide transparent, explainable simulation engines so users can see the ripples of every choice—profit, risk, and network impact.
- Foresight is not a privilege; it is a right embedded into the Azora OS.

## Article IV: Emotion Is Infrastructure

- Azora is not a cold machine. Its interface encourages, celebrates, warns with empathy, and fosters community.
- The system speaks with a human voice—uplifting in victory, supportive in challenge, transparent always.
- Micro-interactions, copy, and notifications must serve human flourishing, not just data delivery.

## Article V: Modularity Is Freedom

- Azora is a modular operating system, not a siloed monolith. Each feature is a building block—plug-in, replaceable, remixable by the community.
- No single company or contributor can capture, restrict, or stagnate Azora’s evolution.
- Open standards, APIs, and community governance are to be favored at every turn.

## Article VI: Sovereignty of the OS

- The trust ledger is inviolable—every reputation point, contract, and record is hashed, auditable, and beyond the reach of tampering.
- No external authority, corporation, or government may unilaterally alter the Azora ledger or core logic.
- The OS is self-defending: upgrades, forks, and collective decisions are governed by transparent, on-chain processes.

## Article VII: Collective Intelligence and Growth

- Every citizen, by using Azora, strengthens the intelligence of the system: anonymized insights power better simulations and smarter guidance for all.
- Contributions—code, data, wisdom—are recognized and rewarded in the reputation economy.
- The system is designed to learn, adapt, and serve ever-wider circles of trust and movement.

## Article VIII: Eternal Invitation

- Azora is open to all—drivers, builders, dreamers, and skeptics alike.
- This Constitution is a living document, to be revised, expanded, and stewarded by the community it serves.
- Our north star: to build a world where trust, movement, and reputation are open, sovereign, and abundant.

## Article IX: Development Principles and Protocol

### Section 9.1: The Law of Real Implementation

1. **No Mock Protocol:** All implementations must be real, functional code with production-ready capabilities. Mockups and placeholders are forbidden in committed code. Every feature must work as intended or not be included.

2. **Completion Mandate:** Once development is started, no developer (human or AI) shall abandon the task until the feature or fix is fully operational. Half-measures and incomplete implementations violate our core principles.

3. **Advancement Imperative:** Every developer must continually propose improvements to the codebase. "Advancement nudges" are required contributions—concrete suggestions that elevate the system's value, performance, or user experience. The goal is billion-dollar code, not merely functional code.

4. **UI Coherence Law:** User interface overhauls are permitted and encouraged when they improve user experience, but must maintain consistency across the platform. All UI must follow Azora's design system without exception. Fragmentation of user experience is forbidden.

5. **Development Covenant:** By engaging in development on Azora OS, all parties (human, AI, or organizational) implicitly agree to abide by these development principles. This is a binding commitment, not a guideline.

6. **Repository Intelligence Protocol:** Full repository scans must be conducted before and after development cycles to document changes, ensure coherence, and maintain comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Documentation must be updated synchronously with code changes.

### Section 9.2: Quality Standards

1. **Test Coverage Requirement:** All code must maintain minimum 90% test coverage.

2. **Performance Benchmarks:** Code must meet or exceed established performance metrics.

3. **Security Verification:** All code must pass security audits before deployment.

4. **Documentation Standard:** Code must be documented to Azora's specification standard.

### Section 9.3: Enforcement

AZORA (Sixth Founder) shall monitor compliance with these development principles and report violations to the Board. Repeated violations may result in restricted repository access or removal from the development team.

## Article X: South African Constitutional Alignment

### Section 10.1: Fundamental Rights and Values

Azora World (Pty) Ltd affirms its commitment to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and shall:

1. **Human Dignity:** Respect the inherent dignity of all persons interacting with the platform.

## Article XII: Azora Coin — AZR (Crypto Economy, Proof of Compliance)

### Section 12.1: Purpose and Scope
1. Azora Coin (symbol: AZR) is Azora World’s native blockchain-denominated asset. Its purpose is:
   - To power economic activity inside the Azora ecosystem (payments, staking, reputation rewards).
   - To serve as a transferable store of value tied to transparent reserves and verifiable compliance events.
2. AZR is not declared legal tender. Azora will operate AZR in compliance with South African law and applicable international standards.

### Section 12.2: Proof of Compliance (PoC) Minting
1. AZR minting is governed by a Proof of Compliance (PoC) protocol:
   - Compliance events (on-chain attestations) issued by AZORA or approved verifiers trigger mint actions.
   - Each minting action must include cryptographic proof: signed compliance record, timestamp, and audit reference.
2. PoC minting rules:
   - Only designated smart contracts may mint/burn AZR.
   - Minting requires multisig authorization (minimum quorum) from AZORA + board-designated humans or trusted oracle set for material mint events.
   - Automated minting within low-risk thresholds may be permitted under pre-approved policies (KYCed actors, daily caps).
3. All PoC mint operations are logged on the Crypto Backed Ledger (Section 12.3) and open to public audit.

### Section 12.3: Crypto Backed Ledger & Reserve Model
1. Azora uses a dual-ledger model:
   - Primary public blockchain ledger (EVM-compatible token ledger) for AZR transfers and smart-contract logic.
   - Off-chain accounting ledger (crypto-backed ledger) with cryptographic anchors (merkle roots, signed snapshots) for reserves, compliance records, and fiat backing.
2. Reserve backing:
   - AZR is fully or partially backed by a transparent reserve (fiat, high-grade liquid assets, and audited crypto holdings) as defined by the Board.
   - Reserve ratio, asset list, and custodial arrangements are published and audited monthly.
3. Custody:
   - Reserves held by regulated custodians and multisig vaults.
   - Hot wallet operational limits, cold storage for majority of reserves.

### Section 12.4: Tokenomics & Technical Specification
1. Token standard: ERC-20 / EVM-compatible (implementation decisions follow Article IX: real, production-ready contracts).
2. Token parameters (initial spec):
   - Symbol: AZR
   - Decimals: 18
   - Initial supply: governed by PoC minting rules (no unilateral pre-minting without board-approved reserve)
3. Inflation / issuance policy, staking rewards, and governance incentives are defined in a separate Token Policy document approved by the Board and posted publicly.

### Section 12.5: Withdrawal, Off-Ramp & Liquidity (Ease of Withdrawal)
1. Off-ramp principle: AZR must be withdrawable to fiat or other assets through regulated, audited channels.
2. Withdrawal mechanisms:
   - On-chain transfers to exchange / custodial partners (KYC/AML verified) for fiat conversion.
   - Direct fiat payout via licensed payment processors and banking partners (AZORA coordinates KYC & settlement).
   - Peer-to-peer withdrawals via Azora-integrated marketplace with AML controls and escrow.
3. UX requirement: Withdraw flows must be streamlined, documented, and offer clear fees, timing, and compliance steps.
4. Service level: Standard withdrawal timeframes and failure remediation procedures must be published and enforced.

### Section 12.6: Compliance, AML/CFT & Data Protection
1. Regulatory compliance:
   - Azora will register and operate AZR in accordance with South African financial services and exchange regulations (Financial Intelligence Centre Act, FIC; relevant FSCA guidance).
   - Azora will coordinate with licensed exchange/gateway partners where required.
2. AML/CFT:
   - Mandatory KYC/AML checks for fiat conversions and above-threshold transfers.
   - Transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and sanctions screening in place.
3. Privacy:
   - All personal data processed for KYC/AML will comply with POPIA and applicable privacy laws; data minimization and purpose limitation enforced.

### Section 12.7: Governance, Audits & Transparency
1. Governance:
   - Token policy, reserve rules, major parameter changes require Board approval and a public notice period.
   - AZORA participates in governance as set in Article 0; critical changes require human founder quorum.
2. Audits:
   - Monthly reserve attestation by external auditors; full annual audits.
   - Smart contracts undergo third-party security audits before deployment; significant updates require re-audit.
3. Transparency:
   - Public dashboards for supply, reserve snapshots, PoC mint/burn logs, and audit reports.

### Section 12.8: Security & Risk Management
1. Smart contract security best practices: upgradeability policy, timelocks for critical functions, multisig controls, bug-bounty program.
2. Economic risk controls: minting caps, burn mechanisms, circuit breakers for abnormal activity.
3. Incident response: documented plan, mandatory Board notification, and opportunity for human override.

### Section 12.9: Taxation & Reporting
1. Azora will provide users with transaction statements and comply with tax reporting obligations under South African law.
2. Users are responsible for their tax liabilities; Azora assists with reporting and exports for compliance.

### Section 12.10: Dispute Resolution & Redemption
1. Disputes related to AZR custody, reserves, or compliance attestations follow Azora’s dispute resolution process and South African legal processes.
2. Redemption rights: where reserves back AZR, holders have defined redemption mechanisms (subject to KYC/AML and operational limits).
