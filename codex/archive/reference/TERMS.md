## 1. Look, Let's Be Real (Plain Language Section)

Hey, we're Azora. We're a South African startup trying to make AI accessible to everyone. We built this system from scratch, and we're proud of it. But we also need to protect ourselves legally, so here's the deal:

### What We Promise

✅ **We'll try our best** - Our AI works hard, but it's not perfect (yet)  
✅ **Your data stays local** - We don't send your stuff to Silicon Valley  
✅ **We'll keep improving** - This thing evolves every 5 minutes  
✅ **We're here to help** - Email us, we actually respond  

### What We Don't Promise

❌ **100% uptime** - We're not Google (yet). Sometimes things break  
❌ **Perfect predictions** - Our AI is smart, not psychic  
❌ **Magic solutions** - We optimize routes, we don't cure cancer  
❌ **Instant wealth** - This is a tool, not a get-rich-quick scheme

## 2. The Serious Legal Stuff

### 2.1 Acceptance of Terms

By using Azora OS, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, don't use it. Simple as that.

### 2.2 Service Description

Azora OS is an autonomous AI-powered logistics and operations platform. Key features:

- **Quantum Deep Mind AI**: Local neural network (480 neurons, self-improving)
- **Quantum Tracking**: Real-time vehicle tracking and prediction
- **AI Evolution Engine**: Genetic algorithm-based optimization
- **South African Integration**: 11 languages, 6 payment methods, POPIA compliant

**What It Does:**
- Optimizes delivery routes
- Predicts safety risks
- Manages cold chain logistics
- Coordinates fleet operations
- Tracks vehicles in real-time

**What It Doesn't Do:**
- Drive your vehicles (you still need drivers)
- Guarantee specific business outcomes
- Replace human judgment entirely
- Work without internet (for now - working on it)

### 2.3 User Responsibilities

You agree to:

✅ Use the system responsibly  
✅ Not try to break our security  
✅ Not resell our AI as your own  
✅ Follow South African laws  
✅ Pay your subscription (when we start charging)  
✅ Not blame us if your driver makes bad decisions  

### 2.4 Limitation of Liability

**READ THIS CAREFULLY:**

Azora World (Pty) Ltd provides this software "AS IS" without any warranties. We're not liable for:

❌ **Business Losses**: If our AI suggests a bad route and you lose money  
❌ **Vehicle Accidents**: Our safety predictions are suggestions, not guarantees  
❌ **Data Loss**: Backup your stuff. We try hard, but things happen  
❌ **Downtime**: If the server goes down and you can't dispatch drivers  
❌ **Third-Party Issues**: If Retail Partner changes their API and integration breaks  
❌ **Acts of God**: Load shedding, fiber cuts, alien invasions  

**Maximum Liability:** Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid us in the last 3 months. If you're using it for free, that's R0. Sorry, but we're a startup, not a bank.

### 2.5 Indemnification

You agree to defend and hold harmless Azora World, Sizwe Ngwenya, and our team from any claims arising from:

- Your use (or misuse) of the platform
- Your violation of these terms
- Your violation of any laws or regulations
- Actions taken by your employees/drivers using our system

Translation: If you do something dumb with our software and someone sues, don't drag us into it.

---

## 5. Disclaimers (The "Don't Sue Us" Section)

### 5.1 AI Limitations

Our AI is smart, but it's not human. Specifically:

**⚠️ Route Optimization**
- Suggestions are based on data, not ground truth
- Traffic predictions can be wrong
- Road conditions change
- **You are responsible for final routing decisions**

**⚠️ Safety Predictions**
- Risk scores are statistical probabilities
- Crime patterns change
- Weather is unpredictable
- **Drivers must use judgment and follow road rules**

**⚠️ Performance Metrics**
- Predictions based on historical patterns
- Individual driver performance varies
- External factors affect outcomes
- **Human oversight is always required**

### 5.2 Integration Disclaimers

**Retail Partner Integration:**
- We're not affiliated with Retail Partner
- Their data APIs can change without notice
- Integration may break if they update systems
- **We'll fix it fast, but no SLA guarantees**

**Payment Integrations:**
- We integrate with SnapScan, Zapper, Yoco, etc.
- We don't process payments directly
- Payment success depends on third-party services
- **Not responsible for payment gateway failures**

### 5.3 Self-Improvement Disclaimer

Our AI has genetic algorithms that evolve automatically. This means:

⚠️ The AI changes over time  
⚠️ New generations may behave differently  
⚠️ We test thoroughly, but unexpected behavior can occur  
⚠️ Rollback mechanisms exist if something breaks  

**Translation:** It's like having a trainee who gets smarter every day. Usually good, occasionally needs correction.
