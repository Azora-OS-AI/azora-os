## Vesting Rules

### Standard Vesting Schedule
- **Duration:** 4 years total
- **Cliff:** 1 year (25% vests after 1 year)
- **Ongoing:** Remaining 75% vests monthly or quarterly over 3 years

### Example Vesting Schedule
```
Month 0-11:    0% vested (cliff period)
Month 12:      25% vests (cliff completion)
Month 13-48:   Remaining 75% vests gradually (2.08% per month)
Month 48:      100% fully vested
```

### Forfeiture Rules
- **Before Cliff:** All equity forfeited if founder leaves
- **After Cliff:** Only vested equity retained; unvested forfeited
- **For Cause:** All equity (vested + unvested) may be subject to buy-back at nominal value

---

## Accelerated Vesting

### Acquisition Scenario
- In case of acquisition, Board may approve **accelerated vesting**
- Requires **two-thirds Board approval**
- Typically 50-100% acceleration depending on:
  - Acquisition terms
  - Founder's continued role
  - Board discretion

### Double-Trigger Acceleration
- May be implemented: Vesting accelerates only if:
  1. Acquisition occurs **AND**
  2. Founder is terminated without cause

---

## Equity Transfer Rules

### Right of First Refusal (ROFR)
Any transfer of founder equity must first be offered to:
1. **The Company** (at fair market value)
2. **Remaining Founders** (pro rata to holdings, if Company declines)
3. **External parties** (only with Board approval)

### Board Approval Required
All equity transfers require:
- Written notice to Board (30 days advance)
- Board approval by two-thirds majority
- Compliance with drag-along and tag-along rights

---

## Option Pool (10%)

### Purpose
Reserved for:
- Key strategic hires (engineers, sales, operations)
- Advisors and mentors
- Early employees demonstrating exceptional value
- Board-approved allocations

### Allocation Process
- Recommended by CEO
- Approved by Board (majority vote)
- Subject to standard vesting (4 years, 1-year cliff)

### Replenishment
- Option pool may be replenished during funding rounds
- Typically diluted pro rata across all shareholders

---

## Drag-Along Rights

If **65% or more** of shareholders approve a sale or acquisition:
- All remaining shareholders must participate
- Protects against minority blocking strategic exits

---

## Tag-Along Rights

If **Sizwe Ngwenya** (majority shareholder) sells equity:
- Other founders have the right to sell their shares on the same terms
- Protects minority shareholders from being left behind

---

## Anti-Dilution Protection

### For Sizwe Ngwenya (65%)
- Maintains control through anti-dilution provisions
- Future funding rounds structured to preserve founder control
- Minimum 51% ownership maintained unless founder consents

### For Other Founders
- Pro rata participation rights in future funding rounds
- Can maintain ownership percentage by investing in new rounds

---

## Equity Valuation

### Pre-Funding
- Nominal value: R1 per share
- Valuation determined by Board for internal transfers

### Post-Funding
- Fair market value determined by:
  - Recent funding round price
  - Independent valuation (for major transactions)
  - Board determination (for minor transactions)

---

## Share Classes

### Ordinary Shares
- Voting rights: 1 vote per share
- Economic rights: Pro rata to ownership
- All founders hold ordinary shares initially

### Preference Shares
- May be issued to investors in funding rounds
- Typically non-voting or limited voting
- Liquidation preference over ordinary shares

---

## Exit Scenarios

### IPO
- All equity converts to publicly tradable shares
- Lock-up period typically 6-12 months
- Vesting schedules continue until complete

### Acquisition
- Equity typically converts to:
  - Cash payment, or
  - Acquirer's shares, or
  - Combination of both
- Subject to acceleration provisions

### Founder Departure
- Vested equity retained (subject to ROFR)
- Unvested equity forfeited
- Buy-back at fair market value (voluntary exit) or nominal (for cause)
