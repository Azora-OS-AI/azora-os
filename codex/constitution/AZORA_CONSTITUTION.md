## ARTICLE II: AZORA COIN ECONOMICS

### Section 1: Token Fundamentals

- **Name:** Azora Coin (AZR)
- **Maximum Supply:** 1,000,000 AZR (Immutable)
- **Initial Value:** $1.00 USD per AZR
- **Growth Mechanism:** Reinvestment + Value Appreciation
- **Total Lock:** $1,000,000 USD (Base Value)

### Section 2: Value Growth Model

```
Initial Value:  $1.00 per AZR
Year 1:         $1.00 → $10.00 (10x from reinvestment)
Year 2:         $10.00 → $100.00 (10x from scale)
Year 3:         $100.00 → $1,000.00 (10x from network effects)
Year 5:         $1,000.00 → $10,000.00 (10x from dominance)


### Section 3: Reinvestment Formula

**105% Budget Allocation Model:**
- 70% - Infrastructure & Development
- 20% - Student Incentives & Education
- 10% - Founder Rewards (Vested)
- 5% - Emergency Reserve

### Section 3-B: Dynamic Budget Allocation

**Adaptive Economics:**
Peg allocation percentages to real-time KPIs. E.g., if Student Growth drops 10%, automatically re-allocate 5% from Infrastructure to Student Incentives.

**Benefit:** Constitutional homeostasis; automatic response to environment.

### Section 6: The "Famine" Protocol

**Low-Power Mode Activation:**
If external revenue (Article II.3) drops below threshold for 30 days, automatically trigger proportional reduction in reward-based AZR outputs (Student Incentives, Founder Rewards) to prolong Development Fund life.

**Benefit:** Constitutional "metabolism" for survival during economic downturns.

### Section 4: Distribution

- **Students (Active Users):** 400,000 AZR (40%)
- **Founders & Team:** 300,000 AZR (30%, 3-year vesting)
- **Development Fund:** 200,000 AZR (20%, constitutional use only)
- **Partnerships:** 50,000 AZR (5%, strategic only)
- **Genetic Reservoir:** 50,000 AZR (5%, immortal stem cells for Phoenix Protocol)

### Section 5: The "Living Coin" Mandate

**Programmable Value Packets:**
AZR carries Genetic Metadata.
- **Purpose Genes:** Coded for purpose (e.g., Development Fund); smart contracts enforce.
- **Origin Genes:** Immutable birth record linking to creator/pod.
- **Structural Integrity:** Tokenomics and infrastructure unified; ledger health is organism health.
