    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Courses with rich metadata
CREATE TABLE courses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    instructor_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    category VARCHAR(100),
    difficulty VARCHAR(50),
    duration INTEGER,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

### AI Agent Architecture

#### Plan-then-Execute Pattern
1. **Task Analysis**: Parse and understand the requested task
2. **Planning Phase**: Generate a structured execution plan
3. **Constitutional Check**: Validate plan against ethical constraints
4. **Execution Phase**: Execute plan with monitoring and error handling
5. **Result Validation**: Verify results meet requirements

#### Constitutional Governor

{
  "constraints": [
    "Never compromise user privacy",
    "Ensure educational accuracy",
    "Avoid biased recommendations",
    "Maintain platform integrity",
    "Respect intellectual property"
  ],
  "approval_required": [
