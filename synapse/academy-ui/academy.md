Azora Academy — The Living University (Blueprint + Deep Dev Plan) 

New Vision: The world’s first Living University — an ecosystem that continuously learns from its students, adapts to the labour market in real time, and issues verifiable, unfakeable proof of ability. Built to be as respected as any leading SA university, yet accessible on a smartphone. 

This document supersedes earlier drafts and goes deeper than the ocean: product, pedagogy, platform architecture, data models, DevOps, privacy & security, accreditation in South Africa, open credential standards, marketplace design, governance, KPIs, and a 4‑quarter engineering plan. 

 

0) North‑Star Outcomes 

Every learner gets a Personal AI Faculty (Lecturer AI + Tutor AI + Mentor AI) per subject with 24/7 support and measurable efficacy uplift. 

Recognition & Trust: DHET/CHE/SAQA-aligned programmes; credentials issued as Open Badges 3.0 and W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0. 

 

Tutor AI ("the coach"): mastery‑based tutoring, instant re‑explanations, adaptive practice, error diagnosis, scaffolding; traces misconcepts across attempts. 

Data minimisation & privacy under POPIA; learning analytics aggregated/ pseudonymised; subject‑access workflows. 

 

Software Engineering: 48‑hour sprint to design, build, test, and deploy a service with CI/CD. 

Data/AI: from raw dataset to model to explainability note; defend choices orally (viva). 

Cloud/DevOps: IaC to provision, monitor, and remediate; SLOs validated via synthetic traffic. 

Employers scan a VC/Badge QR to verify the issuer’s signature and inspect selectively disclosed evidence claims (e.g., test coverage ≥ 80%). 

 

 

 

5) Academic & Regulatory Strategy (South Africa) 

Goal: Earn trust like UCT/Wits by building on lawful, standards‑aligned processes while innovating on pedagogy and credentials. 

RPL/CAT: publish policies and limits per national frameworks. 

POPIA & ISMS: data rights, cross‑border transfer controls, incident response; build an ISO/IEC 27001:2022 ISMS. 

 

AI Faculty Engine: content generation guardrailed by outcomes & exemplars; tutoring orchestration; mentor job‑matching; human review workflows. 

Evidence Registry: append‑only proofs (hash + metadata) of submissions/decisions; off‑chain storage for artifacts; privacy‑preserving verification per VC DM 2.0. 

Project Marketplace: posting, escrow, team bids, deliverables, employer rating; integration to credentials on completion. 

Governance Hub: proposals, discussions, ballots, policy registry, transparency dashboards. 

Wallets/Verification: DID methods (did:web), revocation, endorsement; verifier web app aligns to VC 2.0 processing rules. 

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 ISMS: risk register, Annex‑A controls (access, crypto, ops security, supplier, BCP), internal audits → Stage 1/2 certification. 

 

7) Programme Catalogue (v1) — Stackable, Credit‑bearing 

All modules are designed for distance delivery with strong support, applied challenges, WIL alignment, and clear CAT/RPL routes. 

Cloud & DevOps: Cloud Foundations; IaC & CI/CD; SRE Basics. 

Cybersecurity: SecOps Fundamentals; Network Defense; Incident Response. 

Software Eng: Modern JS; Backend APIs; Testing & QA. 

Pathways: Advanced Certificate (NQF 6) → Advanced Diploma (NQF 7) → Bachelor (NQF 7+), subject to CHE accreditation and SAQA registration. 

 

RACI: PM (outcomes), EM (delivery), Tech Lead (architecture), QE (quality), Sec/Compliance (POPIA/ISMS), Academic QA (CHE alignment). 

Security: OIDC, OAuth2, FIDO2/WebAuthn; secrets vault; SIEM + SOAR; regular pen‑tests; DPIAs for high‑risk processing (proctoring). 

 

9) 12‑Month Plan (by quarter) 

Start DHET APX‑01 dossier; HEQSF mapping for 2 programmes; CHE consult. 

Submit CHE accreditation for first programmes; SAQA engagement plan. 

ISMS audits → ISO 27001 Stage 1. 

 

10) Risk Register (selected) & Mitigations 

 

11) KPIs & Evidence of Success 

Student: weekly active learning minutes; mastery gains; challenge completion; paid project rate; time‑to‑first job interview. 

Quality: completion & progression; moderation agreement; assessment reliability; RPL/CAT throughput. 

Trust: verification success; time‑to‑verify; ISO audit non‑conformities; POPIA rights SLA. 

 

12) Ready‑to‑Use Artefacts 

12.1 Public Pitch (student‑facing) 

Azora is a Living University — Learn with your Personal AI Faculty. Prove your skills with unfakeable work. Earn while you learn. Your credentials live in your wallet and verify anywhere. 

12.2 Policy pack (outlines) 

Privacy (POPIA): purposes, lawful bases, cross‑border controls, data rights, incident response. 

Assessment & Integrity: applied challenges, viva, proctoring tiers, moderation, appeals, retention. 

RPL & CAT: scope, evidence, limits, SLAs, appeals. 

12.3 Engineering backlog (initial epics → sample stories) 

AI Faculty: content templating; hint generation; misconception tracing; mentor job‑match ranker. 

Credentials: OB3.0 issuer; VC 2.0 signer; verifier portal; revocation list; endorsement flows. 

Assessment: challenge authoring; autograding harness; viva scheduler & recorder; evidence hashing. 

Marketplace: project posting; team formation; contract & escrow; deliverables linkage to credentials. 

Governance: proposals → ballot → enactment; constitution dashboard; policy registry. 

Compliance: POPIA consent/rights module; ISO risk register + SoA; audit trails. 

 

13) Closing 

This is how Azora becomes the world’s first Living University: 24/7 Personal AI Faculty, verifiable ability via a Living Portfolio, Work‑as‑you‑Learn economy, and a Living Curriculum with transparent governance — all on a standards‑aligned, accreditable foundation. 

Next actions (choose one and I’ll execute): 

A) Convert this into an investor/partner deck. 

B) Spin up the MVP backlog in your tracker (epics → stories → sprints). 

C) Start the DHET/CHE application pack with artefact checklists and timelines.
