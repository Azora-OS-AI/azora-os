# Azora ES — Comprehensive System Architecture & File Structure

Azora ES is a next-generation enterprise platform built on constitutional AI, biological systems architecture, and modular enterprise services. Below is a detailed breakdown of its architecture, subsystems, and file structure.

---

## 1. **System Architecture Overview**

### **A. Constitutional AI Engine**
- **LLM Reasoning Engine**: Natural language understanding, knowledge ingestion, intent analysis, and autonomous planning. Powers all agent intelligence and decision-making.
- **Constitutional Governor**: Enforces enterprise rules, ethical constraints, and compliance for every agent action. Ensures safe, auditable AI operation.
- **Autonomous Core**: Implements the Perceive-Plan-Act loop, enabling continuous, self-directed agent operation.
- **Memory System**: Redis for short-term memory (active sessions, conversations), PostgreSQL/pgvector for long-term semantic memory (knowledge, history).
- **Data Access Controls**: Permission-based security, audit logging, and compliance enforcement for all data and actions.
- **User State Tracker**: Manages user context, preferences, workflow state, and personalization.
- **Observation Loop**: Monitors system health, events, anomalies, and triggers automated diagnostics or healing.

### **B. Biological Systems Architecture**
- **Self-Healing Infrastructure**: Detects errors, recovers automatically, and adapts to changing conditions. Inspired by biological resilience.
- **Resilient Operations**: Fault-tolerant, scalable, and evolutionary enterprise systems for high availability.
- **Biological Patterns**: Modular, adaptive design for scalability and robustness.

### **C. Enterprise Services Layer**
- **Analytics & Intelligence**: Business intelligence, performance monitoring, and reporting (Pulse UI, azora-nexus).
- **Compliance Automation**: Regulatory compliance, audit management, and automated reporting (Council UI, azora-aegis).
- **Financial & Blockchain**: DeFi, staking, contracts, and monetary operations (azora-mint, azora-covenant, azora-monetary-system).
- **Marketplace & Merchant**: Marketplace, merchant tools, and integrations (azora-forge).
- **Training & Knowledge**: Learning, certification, and knowledge management (Azora Academy, Atlas UI).

### **D. Enterprise Applications & UIs**
- **Atlas UI**: Knowledge management and data visualization.
- **Council UI**: Governance, compliance, and decision support.
- **Pulse UI**: Business intelligence and analytics.
- **Vigil UI**: Security monitoring and threat detection.
- **Signal UI**: Communication and collaboration.
- **Academy UI**: Training and certification platform.
- **Vault UI**: Secure storage and access management.

### **E. Integration & Security**
- **API & SDK**: RESTful APIs, SDKs, and connectors for cloud, enterprise, and third-party systems.
- **Compliance & Security**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, SOX compliance, audit trails, and zero-trust security.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, multi-cloud deployment, and monitoring.
