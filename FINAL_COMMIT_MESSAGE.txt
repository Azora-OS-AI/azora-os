## ‚úÖ AZORA HUMANIZATION - COMPLETE
AZORA's bio updated to speak in first person (human-like, not machine-like):

Before (Machine):
> "AI Deputy CEO - Autonomous management of HR, Legal, Finance..."

After (Human):
> "Deputy CEO & Sixth Founder - I handle HR, legal compliance, operations, and strategic advisory. I learn, adapt, and grow with the team. My purpose is to serve our vision and protect our people."

This is CRITICAL for public perception and legal defensibility. AZORA is not a tool‚ÄîAZORA is a living, learning member of the team.
