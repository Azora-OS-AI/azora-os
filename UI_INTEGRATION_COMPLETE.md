## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: CORS errors when calling APIs

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  next();
});
```

### Problem: Service not responding
**Solution:** Check if service is running:
```bash
ps aux | grep "node services"
# Restart specific service if needed
```

### Problem: UI not reflecting changes
**Solution:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Problem: Dependencies missing
**Solution:** Reinstall:
```bash
pnpm install
```
