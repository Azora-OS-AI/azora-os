# AI Models Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the AI models used in the Azora OS project. It outlines the purpose, architecture, and usage of each model.

## AI Models

### 1. Recommendation Model
- **File**: `ai-models/recommendationModel.py`
- **Purpose**: To provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Architecture**: Utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

### 2. Anomaly Detection Model
- **File**: `ai-models/anomalyDetectionModel.py`
- **Purpose**: To identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior in data.
- **Architecture**: Employs statistical methods and machine learning algorithms for detection.

### 3. NLP Model
- **File**: `ai-models/nlpModel.py`
- **Purpose**: To process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
- **Architecture**: Based on transformer architectures for tasks such as sentiment analysis and text classification.

### 4. Vision Model
- **File**: `ai-models/visionModel.py`
- **Purpose**: To analyze and interpret visual data from images or videos.
- **Architecture**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks.

## Usage
Each model can be accessed through their respective Python files. Ensure that the necessary libraries are installed and configured before running the models.

## Conclusion
The AI models in Azora OS are designed to enhance functionality and provide intelligent insights across various applications. Further details on implementation and integration can be found in the respective model files.
