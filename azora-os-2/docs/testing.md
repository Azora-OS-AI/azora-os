# Testing Documentation for Azora OS

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy and methodologies employed in the Azora OS project. It serves as a guide for developers and testers to ensure the quality and reliability of the software.

## Testing Strategy
The testing strategy for Azora OS encompasses various levels of testing, including:

1. **Unit Testing**: Individual components and services are tested in isolation to ensure they function correctly.
2. **Integration Testing**: Tests are conducted to verify that different components work together as expected.
3. **End-to-End Testing**: The entire application is tested from the user's perspective to ensure all features work as intended.
4. **Performance Testing**: The application is tested under load to ensure it can handle expected traffic and usage patterns.
5. **Security Testing**: Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed to protect user data and maintain system integrity.

## Testing Tools
The following tools and frameworks are utilized for testing in Azora OS:

- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration testing.
- **Mocha**: A JavaScript test framework for Node.js, used for writing tests for backend services.
- **Pytest**: A testing framework for Python, used for testing AI models.
- **Cypress**: An end-to-end testing framework for web applications.
- **Postman**: Used for API testing to ensure endpoints function correctly.

## Test Structure
Tests are organized into the following directories:

- `tests/contracts`: Contains tests for smart contracts.
- `tests/services`: Contains tests for backend services.
- `tests/ai-models`: Contains tests for AI models.
- `tests/frontend`: Contains tests for frontend components.
- `tests/scripts`: Contains tests for deployment and utility scripts.

## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following commands:

- For JavaScript/TypeScript tests:
  ```
  npm test
  ```

- For Python tests:
  ```
  pytest
  ```

- For end-to-end tests with Cypress:
  ```
  npx cypress open
  ```

## Conclusion
Adhering to this testing documentation will help maintain the quality and reliability of the Azora OS project. Continuous integration and regular testing are essential to ensure that new features do not introduce regressions and that the application remains robust and secure.
