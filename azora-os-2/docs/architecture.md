# Azora OS Architecture

## Overview
Azora OS is designed as a modular and scalable operating system that integrates various services, AI models, and frontend applications to provide a comprehensive solution for users. The architecture is built on microservices, allowing for independent deployment and scaling of components.

## Components

### 1. Contracts
The contracts are implemented using smart contracts on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. Key contracts include:
- **AZR Token Contract**: Manages the AZR token lifecycle.
- **Governance Contract**: Facilitates governance mechanisms for decision-making.
- **Founder Vesting Contract**: Manages vesting schedules for founders.

### 2. Services
The backend is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities:
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Payment Gateway**: Manages payment processing and transactions.
- **KYC/AML Service**: Ensures compliance with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations.
- **Analytics Service**: Provides insights and analytics for user interactions and system performance.

### 3. AI Models
AI models are integrated to enhance the functionality of the OS:
- **Recommendation Model**: Suggests content and services to users based on their behavior.
- **Anomaly Detection Model**: Identifies unusual patterns in data for security and compliance.
- **NLP Model**: Processes natural language inputs for user interactions.

### 4. Frontend Applications
The frontend is built using modern frameworks, providing a user-friendly interface:
- **Dashboard**: Central hub for user interactions and data visualization.
- **Admin Panel**: Tools for administrators to manage the system.
- **User Interfaces**: Tailored experiences for different user roles.

### 5. Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is provided for developers and users, covering:
- API references
- User guides
- Developer guides
- Compliance and legal documentation

### 6. Scripts & Infrastructure
Automation scripts are included for deployment, monitoring, and maintenance:
- **Build and Deploy Scripts**: Streamline the deployment process.
- **Monitoring Setup**: Configures monitoring tools for system health.
- **Backup Scripts**: Ensures data integrity and recovery options.

### 7. Testing
A robust testing framework is in place to ensure the reliability of all components:
- Unit tests for services and contracts.
- Integration tests for end-to-end functionality.

## Conclusion
The architecture of Azora OS is designed to be flexible, secure, and scalable, accommodating future enhancements and integrations. Each component is developed with best practices in mind, ensuring a high-quality user experience and operational efficiency.
