## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the routing and navigation system in Azora OS frontend applications. It details the implementation of the Next.js App Router across various frontend applications, including route organization, dynamic routing, and nested layouts. The document explains navigation patterns between different sections of the application and how routing integrates with authentication and authorization. Practical examples of implementing new routes, handling route parameters, and creating navigation menus are included. Additionally, SEO considerations, client-side navigation performance, and error handling for non-existent routes are addressed.

## Project Structure
The Azora OS frontend applications utilize the Next.js App Router for routing and navigation. The project structure is organized into multiple directories, each representing a different frontend application or service. The main routing configuration is located in the `app` directory, which contains the layout and page components for each route.

## Core Components
The core components of the routing and navigation system in Azora OS frontend applications include the layout, page, and API route components. The layout component defines the overall structure of the application, while the page components define the content for each route. API route components handle server-side logic for authentication and data retrieval.

## Architecture Overview
The routing and navigation architecture in Azora OS frontend applications is based on the Next.js App Router. The App Router provides a file-based routing system that maps the file structure to the URL structure. This allows for a clean and intuitive organization of routes and components.

## Detailed Component Analysis

### Layout Component Analysis
The layout component is responsible for defining the overall structure of the application. It includes the header, footer, and any other shared UI elements. The layout component is rendered for every route in the application.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class Layout {
+children : React.ReactNode
+metadata : Metadata
+viewport : Viewport
+ThemeProvider
+Script
}
```

### Page Component Analysis
The page component is responsible for defining the content for each route. Each page component corresponds to a specific URL in the application. The page component can include client-side logic for data fetching and user interaction.

#### Dashboard Page Analysis
The dashboard page provides an overview of the user's activity and key metrics. It includes components for displaying statistics, recent transactions, and quick access to services.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class DashboardPage {
+services : Service[]
+selectedService : string
+setSelectedService(service : string)
}
```

#### Service Pages Analysis
The service pages provide detailed information and functionality for each service in the Azora OS ecosystem. Each service page includes components for displaying service-specific data and user interactions.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class ServicePage {
+title : string
+description : string
+icon : React.ReactNode
+subdomain : string
+status : string
+onClick : () => void
}
```

### API Route Component Analysis
The API route components handle server-side logic for authentication and data retrieval. These components are responsible for processing requests and returning responses to the client.

#### Authentication API Route Analysis
The authentication API route handles user authentication and session management. It processes login requests and returns authentication tokens.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Client
participant AuthAPI
participant Database
Client->>AuthAPI : POST /api/auth/login
AuthAPI->>Database : Validate credentials
Database-->>AuthAPI : User data
AuthAPI->>Client : Authentication token
```
